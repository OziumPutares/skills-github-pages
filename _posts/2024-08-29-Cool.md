# The Problem:
I have an enum class called direction which I use to represent Bit shifts done on Bit boards like this
``` Bitboard << static_cast<int>(Direction::East)```
or like this (minus sign as Value of Directions::West is -1)
``` BitBoard >> -static_cast<int>(Direction::West);```

Pros:
Shows Direction of shift with constants so no "magic" numbers
Prevents Unwanted Implicit conversions
No runtime branching
Cons:
Very verbose
Inconsistent shift sign directions
Minus sign

# Solution 1
implement an operator<< and use an if statement to check if Direction is negative

```
constexpr auto operator<<(Arithmetic auto& value, Direction shift) {
    if (static_cast<int>(shift) < 0)
    {
        return value >> -static_cast<int>(shift);
    }
    return value << static_cast<int>(shift);
}```

So now you can use the direction enum like so:
``` BitBoard << Direction::East ```
or like so:
``` BitBoard << Direction::West ```

Pros:
Still no "magic" numbers
Also no unwanted Implicit conversions
Less verbose
Consistent Shift sign
Cons:
**Runtime Branching**

since this is a chess engine maximum performance is needed so this is not acceptable
